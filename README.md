# Apply, A Board of Directors Application for Nonprofits
In the nonprofit world, it can be difficult to find talented individuals who believe in the cause
and who are willing to volunteer their time and resources to further the mission of an organization.
Too often, nonprofit organizations find themselves accepting individuals with no prior board, finance,
governance, legal, or managerial experience.  These individuals are also woefully unaware of the amount 
of dedication and time required by nonprofit boards.  Apply helps communicate expectations and mitigate
any impact from lacking experience by integrating nonprofit board training directly into the application
process; with Apply, no longer will applications be received a nonprofit board by individuals who aren't
completely aware of the organization's mission, philosophies, programs and services, policies, board
expectations, legal duties, or how to read financial statements.

# Getting Started
Apply is in its infancy.  To contribute, you'll need the [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/install) platform.

    curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh
    git clone https://github.com/enove/Apply.git
    cd Apply
    meteor npm install
    meteor

Then navigate your web browser to http://localhost:3000/
